                From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
                <p>
                    Kirby (Japanese: カービィ, Hepburn: Kābī, Japanese 
                    pronunciation: [kaːbiː]) is the titular character and 
                    protagonist of the Kirby series of video games owned by 
                    Nintendo and HAL Laboratory. He first appeared in Kirby's 
                    Dream Land (1992), a platform game for the Game Boy. 
                    Since then, Kirby has appeared in over 50 games, ranging 
                    from action platformers to puzzle, racing, and even 
                    pinball, and has been featured as a playable character in 
                    every installment of the Super Smash Bros. series 
                    (1999–present). He has also starred in his own anime and 
                    manga series. Since 1999, he has been voiced by Makiko 
                    Ohmoto.

                    Kirby's signature skill is his ability to inhale objects 
                    or creatures and spit them out as projectiles, as well as 
                    the ability to suck in air to float over obstacles. His 
                    Copy Ability grants him the power to adopt the abilities 
                    of the creatures he inhales, while also wearing various 
                    costumes or transforming his shape. He uses these 
                    abilities to rescue various lands, such as his homeworld 
                    Planet Popstar, from evil forces and antagonists, such as 
                    Dark Matter or Nightmare. On these adventures, he often 
                    crosses paths with his rivals, King Dedede and 
                    Meta Knight. In virtually all of his appearances, Kirby is 
                    depicted as a cheerful, innocent and food-loving character.

                    Critics have described him as one of the cutest and most 
                    lovable characters in gaming. He has achieved high 
                    popularity with gamers in Japan. He has also been praised 
                    for being one of the most versatile characters, due to 
                    starring in a large catalogue of games that cuts across a 
                    variety of video game genres.

                <p>
                    Kirby was created by Masahiro Sakurai as the player 
                    character of the 1992 video game Kirby's Dream Land. 
                    Sakurai conceived the idea around May 1990 at the age 
                    of 19 while he was working at HAL Laboratory.[2] The 
                    character's design was intended to serve as a placeholder 
                    graphic for the game's original protagonist in early 
                    development and thus was given a simplistic ball-like 
                    appearance. Sakurai switched to the placeholder design 
                    after deciding that it served the character better. The 
                    character was known as Popopo (ポポポ) during development, 
                    as the first game was planned to be titled Harukaze 
                    Popopo (lit. "Spring Breeze Popopo", or "Popopo of the 
                    Spring Breeze"). The game was later renamed to Twinkle 
                    Popo; however, after Nintendo became involved in its 
                    release, Nintendo and HAL chose to change the name of 
                    the game and its protagonist so that it would appeal to 
                    Western audiences.[3] The name "Kirby" was chosen from a 
                    list of potential names provided by Nintendo of 
                    America.[4] Shigeru Miyamoto stated that "Kirby" was 
                    chosen partly in honor of American lawyer John Kirby, who 
                    defended Nintendo in the Universal City Studios, Inc. v. 
                    Nintendo Co., Ltd. case, and partly because the 
                    harsh-sounding name contrasted amusingly with the 
                    character's cute appearance.[5]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on Kirby's design, Sakurai said that he wanted 
                    to create "a cute main character who everyone will love". 
                    Satoru Iwata added that Kirby was given a simple, circular 
                    design so that anyone would be able to draw him.[4] The 
                    BBC quoted Negative World: "Kirby has a great design. He's 
                    expressive, iconic, instantly-recognisable, and easy for 
                    kids to draw."[6]

                <p>
                    Kirby appears white in Kirby's Dream Land due to the 
                    grayscale palette of the Game Boy system. Sakurai always 
                    intended the character to be pink, though this was unknown 
                    to the development team at first; in particular, Miyamoto 
                    thought that Kirby would have been yellow based upon 
                    similar characters, but thought that pink was a more 
                    distinctive choice.[4] Kirby appears white in the game's 
                    North American promotional materials and artwork to 
                    reflect the character's in-game appearance.[7] Miyamoto's 
                    color choice was repurposed in some games for secondary 
                    players.[8]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a miniseries on YouTube where he discussed the 
                    development of Kirby's Dream Land, Sakurai said that he 
                    wanted Kirby to fly because he thought it would be unfair 
                    for the player to lose a life by missing a jump. He also
                    had the idea of Kirby using his tongue to grab enemies in 
                    a similar way to Yoshi, but then decided to have him 
                    inhale and spit them out instead.[9] For the development 
                    of the second game titled Kirby's Adventure, Iwata said 
                    that the team had started with over 40 abilities before 
                    reducing them to the number in the final game. These 
                    originally included the ability to shrink, create blocks, 
                    ride a rocket and also an animal ability that involved 
                    scratching and biting enemies.[4][10]
                </p>
                <p>
                    HAL Laboratory executive director, Shinya Kumazaki said 
                    that Kirby is a neutral character, designed to reflect 
                    the player's emotions in the game, and for this reason he 
                    does not express strong emotions that could conflict with 
                    the player.[11] In North America, Kirby consistently 
                    appears in artwork with a more serious expression than in 
                    Japan, where his expression is cheerful.[12] Kumazaki 
                    said that the more battle-ready appearance is intended to 
                    appeal to a wider audience in North America, based on 
                    feedback and market research from Nintendo of America.[13] 
                    In 2002, Sakurai said that voice acting for Kirby had been 
                    purposefully restricted because clear speech would have 
                    seemed unnatural for a pixelated sprite character and it 
                    could typecast him as a particular character type.[14]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kirby's spherical shape presented certain challenges when 
                    transitioning him to a 3D character. Tatsuya Kamiyama at 
                    Hal Laboratory explained that it was difficult to 
                    determine which direction he was facing when viewed from 
                    behind, which meant that facing enemies correctly in 
                    order to inhale and spit them out could create 
                    frustration. This was particularly problematic for ranged 
                    attacks and so for Kirby and the Forgotten Land a subtle, 
                    automatic homing system was developed to help the player 
                    target nearby enemies.[15] Kumazaki said that the Mouthful 
                    Mode concept began by asking what Kirby is and exploring 
                    his shape-shifting nature, as the team wanted him to have 
                    inhuman abilities.[16] He also said that although Kirby's 
                    Mouthful Mode appears to give him the ability to hold 
                    anything in his mouth, there are rules governing what he 
                    can swallow. During development, the team focused on 
                    defining the different shapes he can make and what he can 
                    do with the shapes, rather than giving him new powers. 
                    He also explained that the core concept of each game in 
                    the series is to make Kirby the hero, although the 
                    character has no aspirations or sense of morality due to 
                    being a pure, blank slate character.[17]

                    Since Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards (2000), Kirby has been 
                    voiced by Japanese voice actress Makiko Ohmoto. She also 
                    voiced him in every title in the Super Smash Bros. series, 
                    beginning with the first Super Smash Bros. game in 
                    1999.[18]

                <h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Kirby hails from Planet Popstar, a yellow star, and spends 
                    most of his time in a territory called Dream Land.[8] He 
                    has a pink, spherical, body with small stubby arms and 
                    large red feet. His body composition has not been 
                    revealed, but Kumazaki stated that his animation is based 
                    on "a human running energetically, with the thighs, knees, 
                    and ankles invisible, but nevertheless accounted for".[19] 
                    His body is soft and flexible, allowing him to stretch or 
                    flatten and adopt different shapes, open his mouth very 
                    wide to inhale foes, or inflate himself with air and fly. 
                    Despite this malleability, certain parts of Kirby do not 
                    stretch in order to maintain his cuteness, such as the 
                    distance between his two eyes and between his eyes and 
                    mouth.[17] Kirby is characterised by his childlike 
                    innocence and his insatiable appetite.[20] When he 
                    swallows enemies, Kirby does not digest them in his 
                    stomach. Instead, they disappear and reappear somewhere in 
                    the game world.[11] Kirby's official height is 20 cm 
                    (about 8 in).[8]

                    While the English manual for Kirby's Dream Land refers to 
                    Kirby as a "little boy",[21] the Japanese Kirby 
                    encyclopedia Hoshi no Kābī Pupupu Taizen: 20th Anniversary 
                    (星のカービィプププ大全 : 20th Anniversary) lists Kirby's 
                    gender as "unknown".[1] Sakurai wrote Kirby's profile, 
                    which also lists the character's gender as "unknown"[22] 
                    and once jokingly questioned whether Kirby could actually 
                    be female.[23] Likewise, Makiko Ohmoto stated that Kirby's 
                    gender is unknown[24] and explained that she performs the 
                    character just as "Kirby" without caring about the 
                    character's gender.[25]
                </p>
                <p>
                    When asked what sort of being Kirby is, Kumazaki said that 
                    he is an "always-shifting and mysterious individual". HAL 
                    producer Tadashi Kamitake said that Kirby has a unique 
                    personality but is also like a blank sheet of paper as he 
                    can transform into anything that he sucks up. He explained 
                    that because he embodies these two opposite extremes, he 
                    can be an indestructible superhero while also being a 
                    friend.[26]

                <p>
                    Kirby's signature ability involves inhaling enemies and 
                    objects, then either swallowing them or spitting them out 
                    with incredible force. He also has the ability to fly. 
                    Kirby's Adventure introduced the Copy Ability, allowing 
                    Kirby to mimic the abilities of his foes by swallowing 
                    them, giving him a variety of powers, such as breathing 
                    fire. Instead of finding and using power ups, Kirby uses 
                    his enemies as power ups.[27] Kirby Super Star expanded 
                    on the concept of the Copy Ability by introducing 
                    multi-functional techniques for each ability.[28] In Kirby 
                    Super Star, Kirby can sacrifice his current Copy Ability 
                    to create a "Helper", which can be controlled by the game 
                    or a second player.[29] Kirby Star Allies (2018) has a 
                    similar mechanic where he can create small pink hearts 
                    that can be thrown at enemies to turn them into an ally.
                    [30] Since Kirby's Adventure, the Kirby games have 
                    introduced a large variety of Copy Abilities, which grant 
                    him numerous powers and costumes, including Sword, in 
                    which he obtains a sword and appearance similar to Link, 
                    Artist, where his creations come to life, and Needle, 
                    where he wears a spiky hat.[31] Kirby and the Forgotten 
                    and further evolved Kirby's skills by allowing the player 
                    to upgrade his Copy Abilities multiple times, making them 
                    even more powerful, such as his Fire ability, which can be 
                    upgraded to Volcano Fire and Dragon Fire.[32] The game's 
                    Mouthful Mode mechanic gives Kirby the ability to inhale 
                    objects, such as a car, and embody its shape and function.

                    Since his debut in 1992, Kirby has been the protagonist of 
                    the Kirby series. Most Kirby games are platform games, but 
                    his large catalogue also cuts across a variety of genres, 
                    including pinball, fighting, racing, block puzzle and 
                    party games.[34] Throughout his adventures, Kirby has been 
                    pitted against various enemies, including the primary 
                    antagonist of the series, a recurring penguin called King 
                    Dedede.[35]

                    Kirby made his debut on the Game Boy in 1992 in Kirby's 
                    Dream Land, a 2D side scrolling platform game that 
                    introduced his ability to suck, swallow, and spit out 
                    enemies as projectiles alongside other moves such as 
                    running, jumping and flying. The obtainable food items in 
                    the game act as power ups and grant him a variety of 
                    abilities. Upon reaching the end of a level, Kirby 
                    confronts a final boss, such as Whispy Woods or King 
                    Dedede.[36] Due to the Game Boy screen's limited colour 
                    palette, he appeared in grey rather than his typical pink 
                    hue.[37] A year later, Kirby's Adventure on the NES 
                    introduced his copy ability and other moves, such as the 
                    ability to dash and slide kick, and a recurring rival 
                    named Meta Knight.[36] Kirby's appearance was nearly 
                    identical to his previous iteration, although he was 
                    slightly shorter, his body was rendered in pink and his 
                    face was enhanced with dark pink ovals.[37] He again 
                    combats King Dedede, but must also defeat an entity named 
                    Nightmare, whom he accidentally releases with the Star 
                    Rod.[35] In 1995, another platform game was released on 
                    the Game Boy titled Kirby's Dream Land 2. Kirby is 
                    accompanied by three animal friends who aid him during his 
                    adventure named Rick the hamster, Coo the owl, and Kine 
                    the fish.[38] His in-game appearance was returned to grey, 
                    and he was slightly taller than his NES incarnation, 
                    although he is pink in the game's box art.[37] In the 
                    extended finale, Kirby battles a boss called Dark Matter, 
                    an entity that transforms into a one-eyed black orb.[35] 
                    In 1996, Kirby Super Star was released on the Super 
                    Nintendo Entertainment System, a compilation of eight mini 
                    games, such as Gourmet Race, where Kirby races against 
                    King Dedede in a food collecting competition. It was the 
                    first game to introduce helpers controlled by the game or 
                    by another player and also gave Kirby various hats to 
                    illustrate his various copy abilities. In 1997, Kirby's 
                    Dream Land 3, which released on the SNES, introduced new 
                    animal friends for Kirby, including Nago the cat and 
                    ChuChu the octopus.[38] Kirby again defeats Dark Matter, 
                    only to face a monstrous white entity with a single eye 
                    named Zero.[35]

                    Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, which released on the 
                    Nintendo 64 in 2000, introduced 3D computer graphics. 
                    Kirby's form became perfectly spherical.[37] His skills 
                    were upgraded by combining two of the same abilities to 
                    create stronger effects or combining two different 
                    abilities to create a new effect.[36] Kirby's earlier 
                    enemies Dark Matter and Zero returned as new bosses in 
                    the forms of Miracle Matter and Zero2.[35] In 2004, Kirby 
                    & the Amazing Mirror released on the Game Boy Advance. 
                    It was the first game in the series to feature cooperative 
                    multiplayer for four players. Kirby can copy the abilities 
                    of enemies to progress into new areas before facing a 
                    boss. The game granted Kirby some new abilities, such as 
                    Cupid, which gives him the power to fly and shoot arrows 
                    with a bow. The 2006 game Kirby: Squeak Squad was another 
                    2D platformer, this time released on the Nintendo DS. 
                    Kirby can swallow multiple abilities and combine some of 
                    them to create new abilities. By using Ability Scrolls, 
                    his equipped skills can be upgraded to make them more 
                    powerful. He can also interact with the environment, such 
                    as cut grass or melt ice.[36] In the 2011 platform game 
                    Kirby's Return to Dream Land on the Wii, Kirby returned to 
                    the visuals and gameplay of The Crystal Shards but with 
                    four-player multiplay added. He uses his usual copy 
                    abilities but gained some new ones, including Super 
                    Inhale, which is made more powerful by shaking the Wii 
                    Remote.[36]

                    Kirby: Triple Deluxe, which released on the Nintendo 3DS 
                    in 2014, introduced new copy abilities, such as Beetle and 
                    Archer. By collecting a Miracle Fruit, Kirby can transform 
                    into Hypernova Kirby, which allows him to inhale much 
                    larger objects. In 2016, gained new abilities and a mech 
                    suit called the Robobot armour in Kirby: Planet Robobot, 
                    which released on the 3DS. The Robobot increases Kirby's 
                    power and can gain copy abilities like Kirby. In 2018, 
                    the Nintendo Switch game Kirby Star Allies incorporated 
                    elements from previous games in the series, including 
                    Kirby's copy ability, dash and sliding kick. It was 
                    designed for four-player cooperative play, allowing Kirby 
                    to beat stages alongside his allies.[36] With the release 
                    of the Switch game Kirby and the Forgotten Land in 2022, 
                    Kirby transitioned to a fully 3D environment. Alongside 
                    new copy abilities like Ranger and Drill, the game 
                    introduced Mouthful Mode, in which Kirby expands his mouth 
                    to fit around objects to adopt their shape and absorb 
                    their abilities.[39]
