        <br>
            <li>
                Roll 2-3 Tablespoons (depending on how large you like your 
                cookies) of dough at a time into balls and place them evenly 
                spaced on your prepared cookie sheets.

            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven for approximately 8-10 minutes. Take

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 cup coconut oil or unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup whole rolled oats</li>
            <li>3/4 cup raisins</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350°F and line two baking sheets with 
                parchment paper.
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>
                Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and 
                cinnamon in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together 
                the melted coconut oil, sugar, whole egg, egg yolk, and 
                vanilla, whisking vigorously.
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>
                Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir in 
                the oats, raisins, and walnuts, if using, folding into a 
                tight batter. Set the dough aside for 20 minutes while the 
                oven preheats. (Note: if your dough seems too wet to become 
                scoop-able, chill it in the fridge for this 20 minutes and 
                it'll firm up). If your dough is too crumbly, stir in 2 to 3 
                tablespoons water.
            </li>
        <br>
            <li>
                Use a cookie scoop to divide the dough into 20 
                tablespoon-sized balls. Roll lightly in barely damp hands to 
                make them round. Spread out onto the prepared baking sheets 
                and bake until puffed, golden, and a touch underbaked-looking, 
                10 to 11 minutes. Let cool on the pans for 5 minutes before 
                transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
